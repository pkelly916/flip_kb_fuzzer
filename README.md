# N92's modified Keyboard fuzzer
N92's keyboard fuzzer has been modified to include a larger keyspace and start/stop functionality through a new Flood button. Key modifiers are now applied to strings randomly so that CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, ESC, codes are now included in fuzzing. 

# N92's original readme
Turn your Flipper Zero into a USB keyboard fuzzer. Works with the [Xtreme Version](https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware). 
For building instructions please refer to the [official guide](https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware#build-it-yourself).
